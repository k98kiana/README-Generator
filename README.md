## Description
 I wanted to help developers create a well-written README file for their projects.
 This is helping developers that think about a README last when they are creating code, and they want a quick template to fill out for this part.
  I have learned how to use 'npm,' and specifically the inquire package. I have also used learned to use 'const' instead of 'var.'

## Installation
  Node.js will need to be installed. All the files in my repo should be downloaded together, including 'inquirer' from npm.

## Usage
 After the files from my repo are pulled to the respective coding program, first ensure your terminal is located in the matching location. You will then run "node + index.js" files and answer all prompt questions. The answers will be pulled into a README file.  year: '2022',
